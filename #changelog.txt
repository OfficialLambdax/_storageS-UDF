18.02.2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.2.6

	Added
		- _storageGO_GetInfo(). Returns various information about the _storageGO method state, like the amount of storage vars, how many are free and more.
		
		- _storageS_GetVarSize(). Returns the Size in bytes of the given Variable. Objects, Maps and functions are not supported.
		Objects not because im not well into them. Maps not because they are Beta only. And functions.. i mean, how to measure a functions size.


18.02.2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.2.5

	Added
		- _storageGO_CreateGroup(). A storage can no longer be created if the tied group to it doesnt exist.
		It must be created first. If a group is destroyed with _storageGO_DestroyGroup() then the same affect applies.
		This change is done to further protect against accidental memory leaks.


18.02.2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.2.4

	Fixed
		- _storageGO remembering storages, that didnt exist.
		
	Added
		- _storageGO_GetClaimedVars(). A debug function to find all claimed variables of this method.

	Optimized _storageGO


17.02.2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.2

	Added
		- A new method called _storageGO.
		
		
	Likely not going to happen
	
		Maps
			Autoit Beta Only and becomes increasingly slower the more storages are created. Much much much slower then the DictObj.
			Commands like MapAppend() are inaccessible in the Autoit Stable. So Execute() had to be used to circumenvent the Au3Check errors.
			Which also decreased their performance.
			
			Maps would generally only make sense in a low storage count scenario. Everything below 1000. And where, similiar to the DictObj,
			not much data is stored in them. But even then the DictObj is still faster. So why include it then?.


16.02.2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.1

	Added
		- _storageG_Calc() which can be used to calculate the stored data with the given Operator and the given $vElementData.
		Aka 1 + 2. Will save and/or return the result.
		X operator Y - Where X is the store element, operator the given $Operator and Y the $vElementData.
		The X can be Switched to Y by setting $bSwitch to True.
		
		- _storageG_Math() which can be used to run math at the stored data with the given Algorhytmn or Function.
		Aka Cos(5) Or _MyMathAlgo(5). Will save and/or return the result.
		
		- _storageG_DestroyGroup(). _storageG_TidyGroupVars() only overwrites the known variables with Null as they cannot be destroyed.
		Each variable is stored in a Object and that Object stays. _storageG_DestroyGroup() can be used to also remove the object.
		However _storageG_Overwrite() only adds variables to the Object if the are not declared yet. So if you destroy a group and later then
		store data in a previously declared variable then the variable will not be readded to the group, because the function only checks
		if a variable is yet declared, if not so then adds it. The function _storageG_GetGroupVars() would then give a invalid return.
		And _storageG_TidyGroupVars() would not be able to tidy the reused variables. Thats why both functions are seperated.
		
		So make sure you only use said function when you are sure that you are not going to reuse the same variables after the Group got destroyed.
			
	
	Remarks
		_storageG_Calc() and _storageG_Math() where added for when you want to just add or calculate something quickly.
		Using these functions is just faster then using eg.
		
		from	_storageG_Overwrite(123, 'int', _storageG_Read(123, 'int') + 1)
		to		_storageG_Calc(123, 'int', 1, '+')
